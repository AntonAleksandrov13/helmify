# Helmify
Helmify reads kubernetes resources from std.in and converts it to a [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) chart.

Designed as a pipe for '[kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)  build' command output.

Main [use-case](#integrate-to-your-operator-sdk-project) is to create Helm charts for kubernetes operators generated by
[Operator-SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).

## Run
Command accepts chart name as the first argument. If no chart name set, `"chart"` will be used as chart name. 

```cat test_data/kustomize.output | go run cmd/helmify/main.go mychart```

Will generate helm chart with name `mychart` form file `test_data/kustomize.output` representing output generated by
kustomize.

### Integrate to your Operator-SDK project
Tested with operator-sdk version: "v1.8.0".
1. Open `Makefile` in your operator project generated by Operator-SDK.
2. Add these lines to `Makefile`:
```makefile
HELMIFY = $(shell pwd)/bin/helmify
helmify:
	$(call go-get-tool,$(HELMIFY),github.com/arttor/helmify/cmd/helmify@v0.1.0)

helm: manifests kustomize helmify
	$(KUSTOMIZE) build config/default | $(HELMIFY)
```
3. Run `make helm` in project root. It will generate helm chart with name 'chart' in 'chart' directory.

## Available options
Helmify takes a chart name for an argument.
Usage:

```helmify CHART_NAME [flags]```  -  `CHART_NAME` is optional. Default is 'chart'.

| flag | description | sample |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -h -help | Prints help | `helmify -h`|
| -v | Enable verbose output. | `helmify -v`|
| -only | A comma-separated list of processed kubernetes resources.<br/>Useful if you want to update certain objects of existing chart.<br/>Supported values: `crd`,`deployment`,`rbac`. | `helmify -only=crd,rbac`|
| -skip-val | Set if you don't want to update Helm `values.yaml`.<br/>Option may be useful if you don't want to lose<br/>comments or change item order in your `values.yaml` | `helmify -skip-val` |

## Status
Supported default operator resources:
- deployment
- RBAC (serviceaccount, (cluster-)role, (cluster-)rolebinding)
- configmap

TODO:
- webhooks (service,cert, etc...)

### Known issues
- Helmify will not overwrite `Chart.yaml` file if presented. Done on purpose.
- Helmify will not delete existing template file, only overwrite. So, if you delete CRD, re-run `kustomize | helmify` 
crd file will still be in templates directory. (todo: add option for this)
- Helmify overwrites template files on every run. 
  This meas that all your manual changes in helm files will be lost on the next run. See `-only` flags
- Helmify merges `values.yaml` on every re-run. This means that your manual changes in `values.yaml`
  will be preserved but values may be reordered and comments will be lost on every re-run. Merge flow:
  - read values from existing `values.yaml` and stores it in map
  - merges new values into map
  - overwrite `values.yaml` with values from map
