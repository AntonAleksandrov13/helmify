Helmify reads kubernetes resources from std.in and produces a [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) chart.

Main [use-case](#integrate-to-your-operator-sdkkubebuilder-project) is to create Helm charts for kubernetes operators build with
[Operator-SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) or [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder).

## Run
Clone repo and execute command: 

```shell
cat test_data/kustomize.output | go run cmd/helmify/main.go mychart
```

Will generate `mychart` Helm chart form file `test_data/kustomize.output` representing typical operator 
[kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) output.

## Integrate to your Operator-SDK/Kubebuilder project
Tested with operator-sdk version: "v1.8.0".
1. Open `Makefile` in your operator project generated by 
   [Operator-SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) or [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder).
2. Add these lines to `Makefile`:
```makefile
HELMIFY = $(shell pwd)/bin/helmify
helmify:
	$(call go-get-tool,$(HELMIFY),github.com/arttor/helmify/cmd/helmify@v0.2.0)

helm: manifests kustomize helmify
	$(KUSTOMIZE) build config/default | $(HELMIFY)
```
3. Run `make helm` in project root. It will generate helm chart with name 'chart' in 'chart' directory.

## Available options
Helmify takes a chart name for an argument.
Usage:

```helmify [flags] CHART_NAME```  -  `CHART_NAME` is optional. Default is 'chart'.

| flag | description | sample |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -h -help | Prints help | `helmify -h`|
| -v | Enable verbose output. Prints WARN and INFO. | `helmify -v`|
| -vv | Enable very verbose output. Also prints DEBUG. | `helmify -vv`|

## Status
Supported default operator resources:
- deployment
- service
- RBAC (serviceaccount, (cluster-)role, (cluster-)rolebinding)
- configs (configmap, secret)
- webhooks (cert, issuer, ValidatingWebhookConfiguration)

### Known issues
- Helmify defines application (operator) name as the shortest common prefix of k8s objects names. 
  It is possible because operator-sdk using operator name as prefix by default.
- Helmify will not overwrite `Chart.yaml` file if presented. Done on purpose.
- Helmify will not delete existing template file, only overwrite. So, if you delete CRD, re-run `kustomize | helmify` 
crd file will still be in templates directory. (todo: add option for this)
- Helmify overwrites templates and values files on every run. 
  This meas that all your manual changes in helm template files will be lost on the next run. 
  Use kustomize /config folder as a single source of true and make changes there.
  
## Develop
To support a new type of k8s object template:
1. Implement `helmify.Processor` interface. Place implementation in `pkg/processor`. The package contains 
examples for most k8s objects.
2. Register your processor in the `pkg/app/app.go`
3. Add relevant input sample to `test_data/kustomize.output`.

### Test
For manual testing, run program with debug output:
```shell
cat test_data/kustomize.output | go run cmd/helmify/main.go -vv mychart
```
Then inspect logs and generated chart in `./mychart` directory.

To execute tests, run:
```shell
go test ./...
```
Beside unit-tests, project contains e2e test `pkg/app/app_e2e_test.go`.
It's a go test, which uses `test_data/kustomize.output` to generate a chart in temporary directory. 
Then runs `helm lint --strict` to check if generated chart is valid.
